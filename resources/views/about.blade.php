        <h2>Hello, I'm {{ $nama }}</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate web developer with experience in creating dynamic websites and applications. 
            I specialize in frontend development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into web development started when I was curious about how websites are built and wanted to create my own. 
            Over the years, I've honed my skills and started working on projects that challenge my creativity and problem-solving abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, playing video games, and exploring the latest trends in web development.
